# CSS-Country-Flags
This GitHub project is a collection of country flags recreated entirely using pure CSS. Each flag has been meticulously designed and implemented to demonstrate the power and versatility of CSS in creating visually appealing and scalable flag representations.

Sorry for the limited selection of flags at the moment. As a beginner, I'm continuously learning and honing my skills, and I will strive to create more country flags in the future. The more I learn, the more flags I will be able to create.

Features:

Pure CSS implementation: No images or external dependencies required. The flags are created solely using CSS properties and selectors.
Responsive and scalable: The flags adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and can be easily scaled without losing quality.
Easy customization: The CSS code for each flag is well-structured and commented, making it easy to understand and modify to suit your specific requirements.
Comprehensive collection: The repository includes flags from various countries, allowing you to explore different design patterns and techniques.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and use it in your own projects. Contributions and feedback are always welcome. Happy coding!
